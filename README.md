# Stay Fit Dashboard (Power BI)

This repository contains a **Power BI dashboard** for tracking and visualizing fitness data, including metrics such as heart rate, daily steps taken, daily calories, and total exercise sessions for different individuals. The dashboard is designed to help monitor the fitness progress of different individuals and compare it against predefined targets.

## Project Overview

The **Fitness Dashboard** tracks the following key fitness indicators for individuals:

- **Average Heart Rate**: The average heart rate measured over a selected period.
- **Daily Steps**: The number of steps an individual takes each day.
- **Daily Calories**: The number of calories burned by an individual on a daily basis.
- **Total Exercise Sessions**: The total number of exercise sessions an individual completes over the selected period.
-  **Exercise Time**: The total amount of time an individual spends exercising, measured in hours minutes.

These metrics are compared against personalized target values to show how well individuals are performing. Visualizations are designed to help users easily identify trends, gaps, and improvements in their fitness routines.


The **Exercise Time** metric helps track how long an individual spends on physical activity each day or week. This can help users assess whether they are meeting their exercise goals and staying on track with their fitness routine.


## Features

- **Heart Rate Tracking**: Track average heart rate over time and compare it with the target range.
- **Step Tracking**: Monitor daily steps taken and visualize progress against goals.
- **Calorie Tracking**: Analyze daily calories burned and assess if the target is being met.
- **Exercise Session Tracking**: Track the number of exercise sessions and monitor overall activity.
- **Exercise Time Tracking**: Track the total time spent exercising, helping individuals assess the effectiveness of their workout routines.
- **Customizable Targets**: Users can adjust target ranges for each fitness metric (heart rate, steps, calories, and exercise sessions).
- **Data Aggregation**: Aggregated data over a selected period (e.g., daily, weekly, monthly, yearly) is displayed for easy analysis.
  
## Dashboard Features

- **Individual Tracking**:The dashboard displays fitness data for **individual users**, allowing each person's metrics to be tracked separately. You can filter the dashboard by name to view specific data for each individual.
- **Trend Analysis**: A **line chart** visualizes the **trends in the average score** over time. This chart shows how an individual's performance evolves, helping identify improvements or areas that need attention.
- **Stacked Bar Charts**: Four stacked bar charts display the following key metrics compared to the target values:

  - **Average Heart Rate**: Shows how the individual's average heart rate aligns with the target range.
  - **Daily Steps**: Displays the daily steps taken by the individual compared to the goal.
  - **Daily Calories**: Visualizes the daily calories burned, showing the gap between actual and target values.
  - **Total Exercise Sessions**: Represents the total number of exercise sessions over time, compared against the target goal.
- **Target Comparison**: Each of the four stacked bar charts provides a clear view of the individual's performance relative to their target goals, helping users easily assess where they are meeting or falling short of their fitness objectives.
- **Customizable Filters**: Filters allow users to select specific individuals and time periods, enabling personalized and detailed tracking of fitness metrics for any given date range.

## Data Source

The dashboard relies on fitness data, which could be provided in the form of:
- **Excel Files**: Data in Excel format (e.g., with multiple sheets for each  metric).
